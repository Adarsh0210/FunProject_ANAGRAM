This project is just a simple fun game to play and learn english words. I used the idea from the default words.txt file which is available in linux for spellchecking etc and made this simple anagram game . For user interface used the dialog package available in linux . I have provided 3 level easy ,medius and hard as well as hint will be provided if user enterns wrong answer for once .
